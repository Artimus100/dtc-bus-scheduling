# Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System

## Overview

This project is an Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System designed for the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). It aims to optimize bus scheduling and route management using a web application with geospatial visualization and scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- **Geospatial Visualization**: Visualize bus routes on a map using Leaflet.js.
- **PostGIS Integration**: Store and query geospatial data using PostgreSQL with PostGIS.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Implement basic algorithms to assign buses to routes.
- **RESTful API**: Expose endpoints to interact with route and scheduling data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
